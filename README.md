# Pitcher Workload Analyzer ⚾

## Overview
The **Pitcher Workload Analyzer** is a Python-based tool designed to assess the workload and injury risk of baseball pitchers using the **Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR)**. It leverages historical pitching data to identify overuse risks and optimize training loads.

## Features
- ✅ **Calculate Acute & Chronic Workload** (7-day & 28-day rolling workloads)
- ⚠️ **Detect Injury Risk Levels** (Low, Moderate, High)
- 📊 **Data Visualization** (Coming soon)
- 🚀 **Machine Learning Integration** (Future development)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PitcherWorkloadAnalyzer.git
cd PitcherWorkloadAnalyzer
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If needed

## Injury Risk Classification

ACWR Range	Risk Level
< 0.6 or > 1.5	High Risk ⚠️
0.6 - 0.8 or 1.3 - 1.5	Moderate Risk ⚠️
0.8 - 1.3	Low Risk ✅

## To-Do List 🛠️
 Add visualization for workload trends 📊
 Integrate biomechanics & velocity tracking 🔄
 Deploy a web-based dashboard for team monitoring 🌐
